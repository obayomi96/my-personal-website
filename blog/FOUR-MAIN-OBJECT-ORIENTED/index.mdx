I find it interesting to finally understand the Object oriented aspect of programming which is one of the most important aspects of any programming language that is object oriented. (I will only be writing about the theoretical aspect of OOP and no coding examples will be included, but you can explore the external resources at the end of the post).

Here i wan to share my little understanding of OOP and the main principles to wrap your head around if you want to master the whole concept of OOP, there are 4 main OOP principles to know.

First what is OOP?. An object oriented programming language is a type of coding language where programmers not only define the data type of a structure, but also the methods that control the object. Objects are defined as exactly what they are - Objects.

ENCAPSULATION: Encapsulation is why there are public methods and private attributes when you are programming in an object oriented language. We need private methods because coding something and declaring it private means that only you, or your programming team can see the method or attribute. This is so the core of the application you have created does not get destructed when someone wants to modify the program.

POLYMORPHISM: According to dictionary, polimorphism is “the condition of occurring in several different forms”. In OOP polimorphism is when an object takes many forms through a common interface. This form is better understood with an example. Kindly explore … https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html

ABSTRACTION: Most of computer science is built off abstraction. Just think, how else can we represent all the things that go on in the computer? There are two forms of abstraction in OOP, abstract methods and abstract classes.

INHERITANCE: The dictionary definition of inheritance is “a thing that is inherited” and inheritance in OOP is exactly that. OOP languages have a feature where you can define a super class, then as many subclasses as you like! this best explained with an example as well. Please see … https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html

There goes the four main part of OOP that every programmer should understand in order to master the concepts of this powerful tool.

If you’d like to get coding and real world examples on the principles or OOP in general kindly explore the resources below.
